    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
      <p class="aboutInfo">My name is Blake and although I have one year of programming experience, I've' always worked with technology my entire life. From retro console repairs, to digital art, 
        to PC building, to video editing I've done many things, and when I stumble across something new I'm always excited to learn and understand whatever it is.

        My favorite hobbies outside of programming would be hiking, cooking, and growing bonsai trees.</p>

        <h1>Crop Clicker</h1>
        <p class="modalP1">This was my first project I began work on while I taught myself programming. Crop clicker is a web browser game that 
          is heavily inspired from Cookie Clicker by Orteil. I used this project as a way to build on my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge, as well as
          to learn other skills such as launching, updating, and bug fixing a live website. I also made all the art and sound for this project myself.</p>

        <h1>Falling Sand</h1>
        <p class="modalP1">Falling Sand is a simulator of exactly what it says, falling sand. This project was meant to refine my skills as a JavaScript
          developer, making me think logically and creatively. 
        </p>

        <h1>Dice Roller</h1>
        <p class="modalP1">I originally started this project to mess around with arrays and random number generation. As time went on I added multiple dice types
           and dice statistics. My goal with this project is to add more customization options and features while keeping this tool lightweight and fast. During experimental
           testing, I was able to roll 250,000 dice at once!</p>

        <h1>PokeInfo</h1>
        <p class="modalP1">This project was my introduction to working with APIs and working with other peoples documentation. My goal was to take in data from the PokeAPI
           database and display the information in an easy to understand format. Reading and fully understanding someone else's code is a very important skill to have,
            and working on this project helped refine that skill for me.</p>

        <h1>Geometry Blaster</h1>
        <p class="modalP1">Geometry Blaster is the second game I worked on. This project introduced me to Android app development using the Unity game engine. While working on
          this game, I became familiar with practices such as files interacting and changing each other's values, reading documentation, and being aware of code efficiency.
